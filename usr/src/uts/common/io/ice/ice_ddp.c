/*
 * Dynamic Device Personalization (DDP) package load.
 *
 * The E810 needs a firmware package to enable its full pipeline (flexible
 * descriptors, advanced switch and flow rules).  The package is an opaque blob
 * the common code parses and downloads to the device; the driver only reads the
 * file and hands it over.  If the file is missing or rejected the device runs
 * in "safe mode": the common code reduces the advertised capabilities and the
 * driver still attaches and passes basic traffic, so a missing package is not
 * fatal.  This loads before the VSI is built because safe mode clamps the queue
 * counts the VSI configuration consumes.
